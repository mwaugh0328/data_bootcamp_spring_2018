    "Sometimes we need to combine data. In many instances, adding additional data is a way to enrich both the questions that can be asked of your original data set and the answers that can be provided. This notebook looks at ways to  create one dataframe from two or more dataframes.  That's colloquially known as a **merge** or a **join**. There are lots of ways to do this.  We do a couple but supply references to more at the end.  \n",

    "There are two key commands here. First here is `pd.append`. This operation is useful when we just want to stack, say, two DataFrames on top of each other. For example, in the basketball dataset, we could layer on the 2017 and 2018 data. \n",

    "The next important command here is ``pd.merge()`` which is a pandas method applied to two data frames. What you need to provide pandas are the two data frames, the type of merge, and the ``key`` to merge on. Below, I'm going to look at a couple of common examples that I come across, one-to-one merges and many to one merges (in the documentation there is a discussion of many to many merges).
