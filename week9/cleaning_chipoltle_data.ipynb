    "### Preface \n",
    "\n",
    "In class I talked a bit about  mapping out steps to executing projects. This would look like this: identify question and dataset(s) that may answer the question; import data; manipulate data; and then try and answer the question. The question part is hard, but this is more conceptual, not coding. The manipulation part is where coding skills are helpful. Specifically, cleaning, merging, shaping the data to that the data set is usable to answer the question at hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning and String Methods on Dataframes\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook works through some cleaning examples that will probably help you in your project. Here we describe features of Pandas that allow us to clean data that, for reasons beyond our control, comes in a form that's not immediately amendable to analysis. This is the first of several such notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Question (or want)...\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to know what we're trying to do---what we want the data to look like. To borrow a phrase from our friend Tom Sargent, we say that we apply the want operator. Some problems we've run across that ask to be solved:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We have too much data, would prefer to choose a subset.\n",
    "- Row and column labels are contaminated.\n",
    "- Numerical data is contaminated by commas (marking thousands); dollar signs; other non-numerical values, etc.\n",
    "- Missing values are marked erratically.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we want in each case is the opposite of what we have: we want nicely formatted numbers, clean row and column labels, and so on."
